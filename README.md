Hi! Boggart Chess is of course a working title.
I decided to start a dev log to keep track of my progress and keep myself motivated. I am busy with school, but will hopefully be able to post updates relatively frequently.
Hopefully, there will also be a bunch of versions of me in the future contributing to this dev log and game.
